```sql
    /*
      # Create get_my_auth_uid Function (v2 - Direct SQL)

      **PURPOSE:** Creates a SECURITY DEFINER function to reliably retrieve the
      currently authenticated user's ID (`auth.uid()`). This is the direct SQL
      version requested by the user.

      **BACKGROUND:** RLS policies involving joins can sometimes have issues with
      direct calls to functions like `auth.uid()` within the `USING` clause.
      Encapsulating this call in a `SECURITY DEFINER` function can sometimes
      resolve these issues by ensuring consistent execution context. Previous attempts
      to create this function via the SQL Editor failed silently.

      **ACTION:**
      1. Create the function `public.get_my_auth_uid()` which returns `auth.uid()`.
      2. Set the function to `SECURITY DEFINER` to run with the privileges of the user who defined it (typically postgres).
      3. Set search path to empty to prevent potential hijacking.
      4. Grant execute permission to authenticated users.
